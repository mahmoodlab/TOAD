===========
Data Efficient and Weakly Supervised Computational Pathology on Whole Slide Images.

ArXiv | Interactive Demo 

*TL;DR: In this work we propose to use weakly-supervised, multi-class and multi-task computational pathology to determine origins for cancers of unknown primary (CUP). CUPs represent 1-3% of all cancers and have poor prognosis because modern cancer treatment is specific to the primary. We present TOAD for predicting the primary origin of these tumors from H&E images without using immunohistochemistry, molecular testing or clinical correlation. Our model is trained on 17,486 gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) from 18 different cancers and tested on an internal set of 4,900 (WSIs) an external set of 662 WSIs from 200+ institutions and clinically validated on 717 CUP cases originiating in 120 different medical centers.*

### Data Preparation
We chose to encode each tissue patch with a 1024-dim feature vector using a truncated, pretrained ResNet50. For each WSI, these features are expected to be saved as matrices of torch tensors of size N x 1024, where N is the number of patches from each WSI (varies from slide to slide). The following folder structure is assumed:
```bash
DATA_ROOT_DIR/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄDATASET_DIR/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ slide_1.pt
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ slide_2.pt
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```
DATA_ROOT_DIR is the base directory of all datasets (e.g. the directory to your SSD). DATASET_DIR is the name of the folder containing data specific to one experiment and features from each slide is stored as a .pt file inside this folder.

Please refer to refer to CLAM for examples on how perform this feature extraction step.

### Datasets
Datasets are expected to be prepared in a csv format containing at least 5 columns: **case_id**, **slide_id**, **sex**, and labels columns for the slide-level labels: **label**, **site**. Each **case_id** is a unique identifier for a patient, while the **slide_id** is a unique identifier for a slide that correspond to the name of an extracted feature .pt file. This is necessary because often one patient has multiple slides, which might also have different labels. When train/val/test splits are created, we also make sure that slides from the same patient do not go to different splits. The slide ids should be consistent with what was used during the feature extraction step. We provide a dummy example of a dataset csv file in the **dataset_csv** folder, named **dummy_dataset.csv**. You are free to input the labels for your data in any way as long as you specify the appropriate dictionary maps under the **label_dicts** argument of the dataset object's constructor (see below). For demonstration purposes, we used 'M' and 'F' for sex and 'Primary' and 'Metastatic' for the site. Our 18 classes of tumor origins are labaled by 'Lung', 'Breast', 'Colorectal', 'Ovarian', 'Pancreatic', 'Adrenal', 'Melanoma', 'Prostate', 'Renal', 'Bladder', 'Esophagastric',  'Thyroid', 'Head Neck',  'Glioma', 'Germ Cell Tumor', 'Endometrial', 'Cervix', and 'Liver'.

Dataset objects used for actual training/validation/testing can be constructed using the **Generic_MIL_MTL_Dataset** Class (defined in **datasets/dataset_mtl_concat.py**). Examples of such dataset objects passed to the models can be found in both **main_mtl_concat.py** and **eval_mtl_concat.py**. 

For training, look under main.py:
```python 
if args.task == 'dummy_mtl_concat':
    args.n_classes=18
    dataset = Generic_MIL_MTL_Dataset(csv_path = 'dataset_csv/dummy_dataset.csv',
                            data_dir= 'Oncopanel Primary':os.path.join(args.data_root_dir,'DATASET_DIR')
                            shuffle = False, 
                            seed = args.seed, 
                            print_info = True,
                            label_dicts = [{'Lung':0, 'Breast':1, 'Colorectal':2, 'Ovarian':3, 
                                            'Pancreatic':4, 'Adrenal':5, 
                                             'Melanoma':6, 'Prostate':7, 'Renal':8, 'Bladder':9, 
                                             'Esophagastric':10,  'Thyroid':11,
                                             'Head Neck':12,  'Glioma':13, 
                                             'Germ Cell Tumor':14, 'Endometrial': 15, 
                                             'Cervix': 16, 'Liver': 17},
                                            {'Primary':0,  'Metastatic':1},
                                            {'F':0, 'M':1}],
                            label_cols = ['label', 'site', 'sex'],
                            patient_strat= False)
```
In addition to the number of classes (args.n_classes), the following arguments need to be specified:
* csv_path (str): Path to the dataset csv file
* data_dir (str): Path to saved .pt features for the dataset
* label_dicts (list of dict): List of dictionaries with key, value pairs for converting str labels to int for each label column
* label_cols (list of str): List of column headings to use as labels and map with label_dicts

Finally, the user should add this specific 'task' specified by this dataset object to be one of the choices in the --task arguments as shown below:

```python
parser.add_argument('--task', type=str, choices=['dummy_mtl_concat'])
```

### Training Splits
For evaluating the algorithm's performance, we randomly partitioned our dataset into training, validation and test splits. An example 70/10/20 splits for the dummy dataset can be fould in **splits/dummy_mtl_concat**. These splits can be automatically generated using the create_splits.py script with minimal modification just like with **main_mtl_concat.py**. For example, the dummy splits were created by calling:
 
``` shell
python create_splits.py --task dummy_mtl_concat --seed 1 --k 1
```
The script uses the **Generic_WSI_MTL_Dataset** Class for which the constructor expects the same arguments as 
**Generic_MIL_MTL_Dataset** (without the data_dir argument). For details, please refer to the dataset definition in **datasets/dataset_mtl_concat.py**

### Training
``` shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python main_mtl_concat.py --drop_out --early_stopping --lr 2e-4 --k 1 --exp_code dummy_mtl_sex_100  --task dummy_mtl_concat  --log_data 
```
The number of GPUs to use can be specified using CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES, in the example command, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th GPU are used (4 in total). Other arguments such as --drop_out, --early_stopping, --lr, --reg, and --max_epochs can be specified to customize your experiments. 

For information on each argument, see:
``` shell
python main_mtl_concat.py -h
```

By default results will be saved to **results/exp_code** corresponding to the exp_code input argument from the user. If tensorboard logging is enabled (with the arugment toggle --log_data), the user can go into the results folder for the particular experiment, run:
``` shell
tensorboard --logdir=.
```
This should open a browser window and show the logged training/validation statistics in real time. 

### Evaluation 
User also has the option of using the evluation script to test the performances of trained models. Examples corresponding to the models trained above are provided below:
``` shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python eval_mtl_concat.py --drop_out --k 1 --models_exp_code study_v2_mtl_sex_100_s1 --save_exp_code study_v2_mtl_sex_100_s1_all --task study_v2_mtl_sex  --results_dir results
```

For information on each commandline argument, see:
``` shell
python eval_mtl_concat.py -h
```

To test trained models on your own custom datasets, you can add them into **eval_mtl_concat.py**, the same way as you do for **main_mtl_concat.py**.
